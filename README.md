## About
Lambda Wars is a free multiplayer Source Engine modification based on Alien Swarm engine and set in the **Half-Life 2 universe** that brings the war between mankind and their brutal Combine overlords to a traditional real-time strategy (RTS) setting.

Lead the uprising as a commander of the Resistance or crush the rebellion as an overlord of the Combine, with both factions featuring a full host of units, abilities, buildings, research and defenses.

Lambda Wars features full-fledged RTS gameplay and a robust RTS interface and is focused on multiplayer but strategic AI opponents and dedicated singleplayer missions are also included.
